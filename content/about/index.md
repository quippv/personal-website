Iâ€™m a **_backend-focused_ Software Engineer** with a curiosity-driven approach to learning. I enjoy exploring how systems work at their core and understanding the reasoning behind design and architectural decisions. Itâ€™s a process that helps me refine my own development practices and grow as a professional.

My experience revolves around building reliable server-side applications and APIs, working across infrastructure and product development. **I try to focus on creating scalable and high-performance systems**, as I believe these are essential for long-term success.

I like to **focus on the fundamentals** because they make it easier to pick up new technologies and frameworks. This mindset also helps me approach challenges outside of backend development, giving me a broader view of the software ecosystem.

**I work with [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)** for most of my development and enjoy the simplicity and efficiency it brings. Iâ€™m always open to learning from others and sharing experiences, so feel free to reach outâ€”whether here or on [Twitter](https://x.com/myusufadp)!

**Iâ€™m based in Yogyakarta, the beautiful city in Indonesia**(ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©), where I work on some exciting projects. While I enjoy the vibrant local scene, Iâ€™m also open to remote opportunities that allow me to collaborate with diverse teams worldwide.
